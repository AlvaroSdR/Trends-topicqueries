# Google Trends Search Tool
This Python script allows users to search Google Trends for the top trending queries related to a given topic within a specified time range and across multiple countries. The results are then saved to an Excel file.

## Getting Started
To use this tool, you will need to have Python 3 installed on your machine, as well as the requests and openpyxl modules. You can install these modules using pip:

pip install requests
pip install openpyxl

## How to Use
When you run the script, you will be prompted to enter a topic to search for, the number of results you want to see, and the number of days to include in the search. The script will then calculate the dates for the specified time range and search for the top trending queries related to the topic within that range.

The script will also search for the top trending queries across multiple countries. By default, the script will search for trending queries in the following countries:

United States
China
Japan
Germany
United Kingdom
India
France
Italy
Brazil
Canada
South Korea
Russia
Australia
Spain
Mexico
Indonesia
Netherlands
Saudi Arabia
Turkey
Switzerland
Taiwan
Poland
Sweden
Belgium
Argentina
Thailand
Iran
Austria
Norway
United Arab Emirates
You can modify this list of countries by editing the countries and countries2 variables in the script.

The results of the search will be saved to an Excel file named top_searches.xlsx in the same directory as the script.
